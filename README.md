Dream Collage!

Description: 

Dream Collage is an interactive dream journal designed to help users visualize and interpret their dreams. Using intelligent analysis of journal entries with Rosette Text Analytics and the Bing Images API, users can plug their recollections of the dream-state to create interactive collages of unconscious reflections. This is the rails api to provide the backend of the application.
